# Linear Regression

# Description:
This project uses linear regression to predict the price of a house based on a dataset of housing features. The dataset includes information on the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, lot size, and other factors that can affect the price of a house. The linear regression model is trained on this dataset and then used to predict the price of a new house given its features.

# Dependencies:
The following dependencies are needed to run this project:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn

# Usage:
To run this project, you will need to install the dependencies listed above. Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the project by following these steps:

- Clone the GitHub repository.
- Download the dataset file.
- Open the PRODIGY_ML_01.ipynb file in a Jupyter notebook.
- Run the PRODIGY_ML_01.ipynb file.
- The project will print out the predicted price of a new house given its features.

# Results:
The linear regression model can be used to predict the price of a house in any location. However, the accuracy of the model will depend on the quality of the dataset that is used to train the model.

The following are some of the factors that the linear regression model found to be most important in predicting the price of a house:

- The number of bedrooms
- The number of bathrooms
- The square footage of the house
- The lot size of the house
- The proximity to schools and other amenities
